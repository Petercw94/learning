    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>An interesting quote that Bach leaves in the
    introduction is <em>"Homeowners get rich; renters get poor"</em>.
    I'm still not sure the actual meaning behind this quote,
    but it definitely caught my attention, seeing as we are renters
    and not home owners.<br/>
    It would seem that the underlying factor to Mr. Bach's
    investment plan would be to make it automatic, seeing as
    he has repeated that statement several times throughout the introduction.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 1: Meeting the Automatic Millionaires</h3>
    <p>This chapter discussed the story of the first two "Automatic Millionaires"
    that Bach ever met. According to them, and apparently a lot of other people
    <strong>Every time you earn a dollar, you should make sure to pay yourself first.</strong>
    <br>
    According to the two, <strong>you should take 10% of your pay out of your paychecks
    and put it into a savings account before you ever see it or have a chance to
    spend it.</strong> You can start smaller, say 4% and slowly increase to the 10%
    if needed. However, if you feel like you can go above 10%, don't be afraid to
    do so. <em>Pay off your mortgage as soon as possible.</em> Interesting note
    on Mortgage payments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"...take your mortgage payment and instead of paying it in full once a
          month, you pay half every two weeks. You do that consistently, and by the
          end of the year you've made a whole extra payment without ever feeling the pinch."</li>
      </ul>
    <p>At first I wasn't sure what this tip really meant, but then I did some math. If
    you pay your mortgage by month, you will make 12 payments each year, obviously.
    However, if you make half payments every two weeks, you will end up making 13 payments
    a year. 52 weeks/2 weeks = 26 half-payments/2 = 13 full payments. Pretty cool advice.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This next tip is one Blaire has already implemented for us, but it is still
    worth writing down: <strong>No matter how big, you pay for your purchases in cash
    or you don't buy.</strong>In other words, don't pay in credit telling yourself
    "I'll pay it off eventually." The exception here is buying a house.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 2: The Latte Factor</h3>
    <p>Some advice from the first automatic millionaires: <em>"The trick to getting ahead
    financially... is watching the small stuff - little spending habits you have that you'd
    probably be better without."</em> When going through the previous months spendings, ask
    yourself, "was this purchase necessary?" <br>
    One way to get out of the "rat race" (working, earning, spending, repeat) is to stop
    spending just because you can, or, worse, will be able to. <strong>Task: Go through the
    previous months fincances and see if you could have saved at least $5.00 a day, rather
    than spending it.</strong></p>
    <br>
    Here is a cool quote from the end of the chapter:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>"Inspiration unused is merely entertainment."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter 3: Learn to Pay Yourself First</h3>
    <p>It is time to give up the budget. The reason budgets, especially the budgets I have tried
    to make, don't work is because they aren't fun. Sure, you can do it for a month or two, but
    they will inevitably fail, because they are terribly boring. So what is the secret to
    financial success if budgeting isn't it? The title of this chapter should give it away:
    <strong>pay yourself first</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some would argue that legally, you have to pay the government first, but according to
    Bach, you should pay yourself <em>legally</em> before you even pay the taxes. Apparently,
    one way to do this legally is a <strong>pretax retirement account</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The question then becomes, <em>how much should I pay myself</em>? Simply put, you should be
    paying yourself 10-15% of your gross income. This works out to about one hour pay each day
    at your hourly rate.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 4: Now Make it Automatic</h3>
    <p>This chapter seeks to answer to big questions about paying yourself first:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>HOW will you do it?</li>
        <li>WHERE will you put the money?</li>
      </ol>
	 <p>When opening an IRA account make sure to open a <em>systematic investment plan</em>. This will
	 allow you to pull money directly from another account into your own account. There are two ways to
	 do this:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Payroll deduction - Some employers are equipped to pull a percentage directly from your payroll
		and put it directly into your IRA account. However, not all are equipped to do this.</li>
		<li>Deducting from your checking account - If your employer can't do option 1, then you have 
		the option of having your IRA account pull a percentage from your income once it is directly
		deposited into your checking account.</li>
		</ul>
	<br/>
	<p>Now that you have some money in an IRA account, you have to decide what to invest it in. The most
	important thing is not to put all your eggs in one basket. USe the investment pyramind provided below
	to help guide your retirement investing:</p>
	<img src = "./investment_pyramid.jpg" width = 300 height=600/>
	<br/>
	<p>It is important to never put more than 25% in any one stock or company. Conservative investing requires
	investing no more than 5% in any one company, this will prevent a complete loss of equity if the company 
	does tank. One thing to look for when opening an account is a <strong>target dated mutual funds</strong>. These 
	accounts allow you to simply select a retirement year and a professional will manage the account with a space of
	percentages similar to those presented in the pyramid, meaning less work for you. There is a key factor to know about
	these funds: <em>The Glide Path</em>. This distinguishes between a "thru" fund (the account invests through
	your retirement) or a "to" fund (investments stop when you retire).</p>
    <br/>
	<p>If your plan doesn't offer a target dated fund, then another option is a balanced fund or an asset allocation 
	fund. </p>
